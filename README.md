# Wizardy
Dungeon crawler game written in Pygame.

Wizardy is a simple dungeon crawl game where 
the aim is to collect gold by 
smashing pots or killing monsters.
The background scrolls with the wizard 
staying in the middle of the screen 
and movement and attack are controlled 
by the mouse. 

I've tried to write this to allow 
easy changing of the graphics and 
you can design your own levels 
by creating comma delimited map files.
 
However there are limitations to level 
size.
